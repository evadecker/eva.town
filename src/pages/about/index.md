I began coding in the late 2000s, typing into a textarea of vBulletin for a Nintendo fan forum. Without syntax highlighting, `border-radius`, or `flexbox`, I'd spend hours exporting assets from Photoshop and laying out content in CSS.

Type a few characters, and suddenly every `button` changes colors on hover. (From blue to... a slightly different blue!) I thought this was the coolest thing in the world.

I still think coding is cool.

Most of my job titles have included the word "designer", but code is my medium and the browser is my favorite design tool. I fully believe that designing for the web means working *in the medium* of the web—namely, HTML and CSS. Interactive mediums deserve interactive iteration.

I love the web, but when I need to think about gnarly problems, I take my sketchbook and my pen, I find a quiet place, and I write.

For the past three years, I've worked as a freelance designer and developer, embedding on teams to strengthen design systems. I try to help designers learn more about code, and I try to convince engineers they have better design instincts than they think. Sometimes I succeed.

Occasionally I play piano and listen to city pop and noodle with synths. I like [reading](https://goodreads.com/evadecker) about urbanism, transit, and queer history. I'd like to have a garden one day. I'm still a Nintendo fan.

I'm currently open to new freelance or full-time work. If you have a role that sounds like a fit, email me at hey@evadecker.com.
