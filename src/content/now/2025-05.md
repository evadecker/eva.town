The leaves have appeared, the weather is warmer, and I've planted some flowers in my balcony garden which bring me a lot of joy. I finished a class at SFPC and published a new site, [hypertext.tv](https://hypertext.tv). I took two months off from work to focus on [Namesake](https://namesake.fyi), but I'm back to Scribe this week. Focusing on projects is keeping me sane amidst the relentless cruelty of the fascist regime. I keep expecting things to snap, but so far, we just keep bending.
