The fascist has been elected. Our systems have failed. In 2016, I thought they would protect us. Now I am sure they will not. It's up to us to watch out for each other. I'm committing to more time with friends, more dancing, more art-making, more caretaking. To finding small revolutions in dance halls. To avoiding isolation. We're entering dark times, but [there are paths forward](https://wagingnonviolence.org/2024/11/10-things-to-do-if-trump-wins/). Do not give into fear and exhaustion. Keep taking care of your plants, your friends, and yourself.
