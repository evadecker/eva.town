I'm getting into birding. I picked up a [telephoto lens](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1663581-REG/canon_rf_100_400mm_f_5_6_8_is.html) and I've been taking [photos](https://glass.photo/evadecker). Tech has me feeling disillusioned and [burnt out](https://discord.com/channels/1292938214998409217/1461746519182016552/1462117227116626174), but these hobbies replenish a little energy. I want to get more involved in local organizing and activism; the cruelty from this regime is unbearable. Fuck ICE.
