I helped streamline Swiftype's product navigation to organize content according to user need, creating [new navigation icons](https://dribbble.com/shots/2458749-Sidebar-Icons-Round-3) and a set of [empty state illustrations](https://dribbble.com/shots/2499501-Empty-States). With the head of design, launched a new marketing site. In 2017, Swiftype was acquired by [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/).
