I began coding in the late 2000s, typing into a textarea of vBulletin for a Nintendo fan forum. Without syntax highlighting, `border-radius`, or `flexbox`, I'd spend hours exporting assets from Photoshop and laying out content in CSS.

Type a few characters, and suddenly every `button` changes colors on hover. (From blue to... a slightly different blue!) I thought this was the coolest thing in the world.

I still think coding is cool.

Most of my job titles have included the word "designer", but code is my medium and the browser is my favorite design tool. I believe that designing for the web means working _in the medium_ of the webâ€”namely, HTML and CSS. Interactive mediums deserve interactive iteration.

I love working digitally, but when I need to think about gnarly problems, I take my sketchbook and my pen, I find a quiet place to sit, and I write.

I currently work at [Scribe](https://scribehow.com) as a Senior Design Engineer. Previously, I spent time building things at [Cityblock](https://cityblock.com), [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com), and [Swiftype](https://swiftype.com). You can [download my resume here](/downloads/eva-decker-resume.pdf).

In my free time I play piano and listen to city pop and noodle with synths. I like [reading](https://hardcover.app/@evadecker) about urbanism, transit, and queer history, and I tend to a small but growing apartment balcony garden.

Always open to chats and coffee in NYC. [Say hello!](mailto:hey@evadecker.com)
