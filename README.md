## Getting Started

To get started, run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

If it's the first time running the repo you may need to run `pnpm i` to install packages.

Other scripts in `package.json` can also be run with `pnpm`.

## Link Checking

## Notes To Self

Some shortcuts and workflows to remember.

### Dates

Frontmatter for content should include a required `datePublished` and an optional `dateModified` field. Dates should be ISO-formatted datetime strings and *include the time zone of publishing*, like this: `2023-09-26 03:47:00-04:00`.

It's important to include the time zone (EDT: `-04:00`, EST: `-05:00`) so that relative dates (like "4 days ago") can display correctly depending on a user's local time zone, and because I may not always write from the East Coast.

To insert dates in the frontmatter of Markdown files, use the [Insert Date String](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jsynowiec.vscode-insertdatestring) from VS Code and press `command` + `shift` + `I`.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Remember to update `dateModified` when revising articles! It's a mildly annoying manual step, yes, but it's easier (for now) than building something to handle setting dates automatically.
